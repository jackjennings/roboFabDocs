DialogKit
=========

DialogKit is a Python library for creating GUI dialogs in FontLab and Mac OS X Cocoa applications that have a Python layer.

The library implements a subset of the `Vanilla library`_, which in turn was inspired by Just van Rossumâ€™s classic W library. In FontLab, dialogKit wraps the built-in GUI classes ``Dialog`` and ``Canvas`` and adds a few things along the way. The goal is to provide a simple API and consistent, or as consistent as possible, behavior between applications.

`Download, documentation and examples on github`_. At the time of writing, the documentation is part of the download, but needs to be compiled into html.
