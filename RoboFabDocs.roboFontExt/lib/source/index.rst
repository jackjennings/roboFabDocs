Welcome to RoboFab
==================

RoboFab is a Python library with objects that deal with data usually associated with fonts and type design. RoboFab has support for the `UFO font format`_.

RoboFab is available as a couple of relatively easy to install packages. If you're just starting with RoboFab, or you just want to make UFO's, :doc:`this is the place to start <intro/download>`.

For developers and folks who like to keep their fingers on the pulse of digital type, the RoboFab source code is available as a `git repository`_. The git version will be more up to date and might contain new features.
