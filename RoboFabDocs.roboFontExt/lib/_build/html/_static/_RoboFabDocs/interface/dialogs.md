Dialogs
=======

The dialogs module has a couple of basic dialogs and alerts that allow simple interactions. It needs to sniff the os, Python version and look for application specific markers to figure out which code to load. This has grown rather complex with the growing number of FontLab iterations.

## robofab.interface.all.dialogs

The loader module.

## `robofab.interface.all.dialogs_default`

## `robofab.interface.all.dialogs_mac_vanilla`

Dialogs specific for applications on OSX, with access to Vanilla, and Cocoa. Do not load this directly.

Dialogs for environments that support Cocoa / vanilla.
