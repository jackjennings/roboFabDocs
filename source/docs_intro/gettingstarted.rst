Getting Started with RoboFab
============================

Installing
----------

Installing RoboFab is pretty straightforward as installing Python libraries go. But considering this might be the first time you do this, here are a couple of things to pay attention to. First, have a look at the :doc:`installation notes <install>`.

Some remarks for FontLab 4.6 users on Mac OSX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- In MacOSX, you need to have admin permissions to install robofab in MacOS 9 Python.
- If you've downloaded the MacOSX diskimage installer, first copy the entire thing to a nice, accessible place on your harddisk. The ``install.py`` script makes a link to the folder it's in, so if you were to run the install script from the mounted diskimage, RoboFab would be gone after you unmount the diskimage.

FontLab Macros
--------------

RoboFab has some example scripts that show how it can be used in FontLab. In the RoboFab folder, there's a folder named ``Scripts``. In it are two folders that you can drag to FontLab's ``Macros`` folder. After restarting the application the ``Utils`` and ``RoboFabIntro`` folder will have been added to the macro list.

Then what?
^^^^^^^^^^

It depends on your proficiency in scripting and operating fonteditors like FontLab. Some :doc:`notes on scripting <../docs_howtos/scripting>` are available in the how to section. There's :doc:`this manual <../index>` which offers documentation, examples and background. Help with operating your font editor of choice is not available from this site or from the RoboFab developers. Read the manual.
